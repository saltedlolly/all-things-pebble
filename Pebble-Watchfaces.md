# Watchfaces for Pebble

A community-curated directory of **open source watchfaces** created for Pebble smartwatches.

### Please add your Pebble Watchfaces to the directory!

This page aims to be a comprehensive directory of open source watchfaces created by the Pebble community, providing a helpful resource for developers to learn from and contribute to each other's work.

### Contribution Rules

Pebble Watchfaces listed here must be:

- open source and listed on the Pebble or Rebble appstores.
- sorted alphabetically by 'Name' (add your watchface in the correct order)
- 'Name' should link to the app store listing
- 'Developer' should link to the Github repo (or other) containing the watchapp source code.
- A screenshot should be added to the `/images/watchfaces` folder. You can copy one from the app store listing. Use a Time 2 screenshot when possible.
